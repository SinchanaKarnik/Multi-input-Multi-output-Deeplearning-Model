# Multi-input-Multi-output-Deeplearning-Model
Used Laptop dataset(From Kaggle) to demonstrate multi-input multi-output Model

Here I have demonstrated how to build model with 2 inputs and 2 outputs

One output is classification problem while other is regression

Demonstrated how to save the model, use tf-serving and query the model both via Rest API and gRPC API, also shows how to create lighter version of the model using tflite
